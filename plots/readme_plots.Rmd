The Folder "plots" contains plots generated inside the R code of this project.

-   **env\_...** show time-series of the environmental data (Sea-Surface-Temperature, Sea-Bottom-Temperature & Sea-Surface-Salinity) of the individual spawning components. They contain monthly values, as well as a yearly average.

-   **LAI_by_year** shows the time-series of the Larvae-Abundance-Index (LAI) for each spawning component.

-   **LAI_percent** shows the percentage of the total LAI each component contributes over time.

-   **SSB** shows the Spawning-Stock-Biomass (SSB), including the 95% confidence interval, over time.

-   **SSB_component** subsets the SSB into the components using the LAI percent values.
